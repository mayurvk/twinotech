             <p>

Problem Statement:-
		To re-code the given code using different logic statements than given in the problem code to get th e same output.
</p>
  <p>  Outcome:
1. This will Test the logic development of You.
2. Will test your knowledge on ‘C++’ and ‘C’ Language.

             </p>
             <p>
Round Details:-   
Level 1:
•	Participants will be given a simple function block coded with a particular logic along with the output.
•	He/ She has to code the following function with some different logic statements other than the ones given to get the same output.
•	All the participants will be given the same function block to be coded in a given time limit.
•	Top 20 to code it as fast as possible will be selected for next round.
             </p>
<p>Level 2:
•	Difficulty level will be upgraded. 
•	Participants will be given an entire program to code with different logic for obtaining the same output in a given time.
•	Top 10 participants to complete it as fast as possible will be selected for next round.
             </p><p>
Level 3:
•	Difficulty level will be upgraded.
•	All the 10 participants will be given a proper entire program to code in a given time limit using different logic than given in the problem code.
•	Along with the coding of final program indentation will also be considered for evaluation of this round.
•	Out of 10 participants 1 winner and 1 runner up will be announced. 
             </p>
<p>Rules:-
1. Participants should carry the Registration receipt and an ID card while coming for the contest.
2. Participants who would not report on the specified location on time, will be regarded as disqualified.
3. The decision for selection of participants for next rounds will be utterly laid on volunteers and it won’t be questioned by the participants.
                 
                 
4.  If there exists a tie between any two or more participants in any round then a

5. A participant, if found misbehaving, in any way will be regarded as disqualified.
             </p>
             <p>
Scoring System:-
    Everyone will have a base score of 100.              
•	With each meaningful and successful compiled and executed code as fast as possible will be awarded x points where x is base + (300-time used by participant).
•	Each error that the participant will not be able to remove will deduct 2 points each.
•	For the third round proper programming with exact expected output as well as perfect indentation will be awarded 50 points, else points will be deducted.
